# Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch
 
This presentation is part of the Course Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class.

The peer assessed assignment has two parts.

First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.
Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

This presentation adresses the second part of the course project.

The app developed for the first part of the assignment is avalilable at:

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub:
